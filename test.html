*Explanation:*
1. *Flexbox (`display: flex`)* :
    - The `display: flex` property on the `.container` ensures that the text and the image are displayed side-by-side.
    - By default, `flex` aligns elements in a row.

2. *Spacing (`margin-left`)* :
    - The `margin-left` on the `<img>` element adds space between the image and the text for a cleaner look.

3. *Image Size (`max-width` and `height: auto`)* :
    - Use `max-width` and `height: auto` to make sure the image scales properly without distortion.

This approach is clean, responsive, and easy to use. Let me know if you need further assistance! 😊⁽¹⁾
